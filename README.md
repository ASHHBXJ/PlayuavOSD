# PlayuavOSD
A Graphics OSD for FPV, Compatible with most FC

Introduction
============

PlayuavOSD is designed to display flying data from autopilot. It allows the user to customize what data to be displayed and the specific display position.

Features:
1.Dual video inputs, front and rear cameras(real time switch via the remote control).

2.Support multiple types of flight control, such as the mavlink protocol used by APM2.x and pixhawk, UAVTalk protocol used by CC3D and revolution (Beta version), as well as the CAN protocol of DJI (under development).

3.A standard video signal will emerge to be superimposed upon the OSD information in case of failed video input caused by absence of camera or camera breakdown.

4.Graphical interface makes the receiving of flight data easier and more intuitive and reduces brain computing. 

5.Firmware can be updated with the configuration tools while parameter setting can be done via USB directly. 

6.Data transmission is realized with the audio port and ground receiver(such as the tracking antenna). The transmission distance is much longer than radio(under development).
