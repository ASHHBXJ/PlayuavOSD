Major:
 - (SW)Change the compile tool from MDK to the more common GCC.
 - (SW)Code Cleaning for both firmware and config tool. 


Minor:
 - (SW)Support more FCs and protocols.
 - (SW)Go deep into 3D, including an elegant mode, higher resolution, and configuration for 3D display.
 - (HW)Do we have to use the STM32F405 chip? Can any cheaper chip do the job? Need to be tested.
